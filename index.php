              Conscientious attention to these rules will prevent most, if not
              all, gun accidents. Be aware that ignorance and carelessness lead
              to accidents in all walks of life, including the handling of
              firearms.

                  Always
                  keep the gun pointed in a safe direction</font></strong> <br>
              If the gun should discharge, it should not harm any person or
              destroy any valuable property. Careful attention to muzzle
              direction is key to safely handling a firearm. When carrying a
              firearm from place to place, the best way to control the muzzle is
              to keep it in your view. Be aware of what objects can stop a
              bullet, and what ones cannot. In NRA courses, and on shooting
              ranges, the instructor or range officer will explain and point out
              the safe directions available. <br>

                  Always
                  keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot</font></strong>
              <br>
              Under normal conditions guns do not discharge unless the trigger
              is pulled. When holding or manipulating a gun, hold the grip
              firmly and place the trigger finger along the frame or receiver,
              not inside the trigger guard. <br>

                align="right"><strong><font size="+2">3. Always keep the gun
                  unloaded
                  until ready to use</font></strong> <br>
              Guns cannot be discharged unless they are loaded with live
              ammunition. There are many uses of guns which permit them to be
              loaded, but such firearms must always be under your control. Guns
              not in use, but not stored, should have the action locked open so
              that anyone may inspect the chamber and magazine for live
              ammunition. When handing a gun to another person, lock open the
              action (if possible) and check the chamber and magazine by sight
              and feel to ensure than no live ammunition is present. The person
              receiving the gun should also check. <br clear="all">

<font size="+2"><strong>RULE 1</strong> - Treat all guns as though they are loaded </font>(no matter how sure you are that they are not).<br>
<font size="+2"><strong>RULE 2</strong> - Never point the gun at anything you are not willing to destroy.<br>
<strong>RULE 3</strong> - Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire.<br>
<strong>RULE 4</strong> - Be sure of your target and what is beyond it</font> - you can't take that round back after it's fired.<br>
